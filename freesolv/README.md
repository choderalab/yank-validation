# Hydration free energy of the FreeSolv Database (reduced)

## Manifest

- `freesolv-mini.yaml`: Setup and simulation protocol for YANK. The protocol is chosen to be as close as possible to the
one described in [1].
- `freesolv-mini.smiles`: Sub-set of the [FreeSolv database](https://github.com/MobleyLab/FreeSolv) containing SMILES,
name, experimental and computed hydration free energies of the molecules used for validation.
- `expected_output.yaml`: Contains the free energies and statistical errors that are expected. It is used by the code
for automatic analysis.
- `run-yank.sh`: Bash script to run YANK serially.
- `run-lsf-sams.sh`: LSF submission script
- `run-torque-yank.sh`: Torque submission script to run YANK with MPI on the cluster.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Choice of the molecules from FreeSolv

The 5 molecules in the `freesolv-mini.smiles` set were extracted from the full FreeSolv database. The molecules
were chosen firstly to span a large dynamic range and secondly to have reasonable agreement between experimental
and reference computed value.

## Differences in the protocol

There are few difference from the protocol adopted in [1]:
- Instead of running an NPT equilibration followed by an NVT production simulation, we run all in NPT and use
automatic equilibration detection in the analysis.
- Using tleap instead of packmol, we can't control the exact number of water molecules (1309 in the reference paper).
We instead add water to create a 13A buffer around the molecule.
- We use an ewald tolerance of 1e-5 instead of 1e-6.
- We use a single cutoff for both electrostatics and sterics set to 11A instead of 12A and 10A respectively that
were employed for the GROMACS simulations.
- We use hamiltonian replica exchange.
