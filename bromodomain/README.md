# Binding free energy of bromodomain ligand

## Input files
The original GROMACS input files were downloaded from https://www.zenodo.org/record/57131#.WUfkShPyugR on June 1, 2017.
More specifically, the 4 files in each `input/ligandX/` folder were taken from:

- 'complex.gro': 'Aldeghi-et-al-chemical-science-2016/crystal/LigandX/complex/fep_coord.gro'
- 'complex.top': 'Aldeghi-et-al-chemical-science-2016/crystal/LigandX/complex/fep_topol.top'
- 'solvent.gro': 'Aldeghi-et-al-chemical-science-2016/crystal/LigandX/ligand/fep_coord.gro'
- 'solvent.top': 'Aldeghi-et-al-chemical-science-2016/crystal/LigandX/ligand/fep_topol.top'

The `gromacs_include/amber99sb-ildn.ff` was downloaded from https://github.com/gromacs/gromacs/tree/master/share/top/amber99sb-ildn.ff.

## Choice of the molecules
The ligands have been chosen to maximize the dynamical range among those that showed good convergence in [1].

## Differences with original protocol
- We don't run an NVT equilibration before NPT.
- We use an ewald tolerance of 1e-5 instead of 1e-6.
- We use a single cutoff for both electrostatics and sterics set to 11A instead of 12A and 10A respectively that
were employed for the GROMACS simulations.
